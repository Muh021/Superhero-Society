Install XAAMP.
Move the entire folder project in htdocs of the XAAMP file directory.
Create a database with XAAMP and run the create.sql and load.sql with the csv to create a database and load the data.
On the browser type localhost/project and it should open the website and whatever is done on the website should reflect on the database.
